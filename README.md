# A Huge Number of Go Examples, Exercises 

Best way of learning is doing. Inside this repository, you will find thousands of Go examples, exercises. I initially created this repository for my learning path: **[Go: Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-go-the-complete-bootcamp-course-golang/?referralCode=5CE6EB34E2B1EF4A7D37)**. 
It would be amazing if every programmer who is not yet enrolled in the course will start to learn for free as well. 
So here it is. Enjoy.
